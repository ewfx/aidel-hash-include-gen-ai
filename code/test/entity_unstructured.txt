
Blocked Person X owns 50 percent of Entity A, and Entity A owns 50 percent of Entity B. Entity B is blocked as person X’s own, indirectly, significant part of Entity B. In addition, Blocked Person X’s 50 percent ownership of Entity A makes Entity A a blocked entity. Entity A’s 50 percent ownership of Entity B in turn makes Entity B too, a blocked entity.
